**This repository is deprecated! We've moved all EO objects from this repository
to [objectionary/eo](https://github.com/objectionary/eo).**

[EO](https://www.eolang.org) objects for collections. The abstractions of lists, maps, sets, and others.

This is how it works:

```
eq. > @
  with.
    QQ.collections.list
      * 1 2
    3
  QQ.collections.list
    * 1 2 3
```

### List
The object `QQ.collections.list` is a decorator of `QQ.array`.

The attribute `is-empty` is TRUE if the length of the
array is zero.

The attribute `eq` is TRUE if each element of the array is equal to the corresponding element of another array and the lengths of both arrays are the same.

The attribute `without` is a new array with the i-th element removed.

The attributes `each`, `reduce`, and `map` are respectively similar to forEach, reduce, find, reduce, and map methods of Array object in JavaScript (ECMA, 2011). 
A few “twin” attributes `reducedi`,  and `mappedi`are semantically the same, but with an extra int argument as a counter of a cycle.
The attribute `slice` is a part of the array.

```
[] > list-test
  QQ.hamcrest.assert-that > @
    reducedi.
      QQ.collections.list
        * TRUE TRUE FALSE
      TRUE
      [a i x]
        and. > @
          x
          a
    $.equal-to FALSE
```

### Map

The object `QQ.collections.map` is a decorator of `QQ.array` of pairs (_k_, _v_).
The map ensures that all _k_ are always unique. It is expected that each _k_ has `as-hash` attribute that behaves as `int`.
The attributes `with`, `without`, `found`, and `foundi` are reimplemented in `map`.

```
[] > map-test
  QQ.hamcrest.assert-that > @
    at.
      found.
        with.
          QQ.collections.map *
          1
          "a"
        1
      0
    $.equal-to "a"
```
